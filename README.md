# os-assistant
An Open Source alternative to the popular OSBuddy. Developed by a Runescape fan and computer science student at FIU. The client will be open source and will get a Jagex Moderators approval. As of right now, until a JMod's approval please do not use it for playing. If you would like to contribute you must not violate Jagex's 3rd party client rules. This means no bot features or else we will have to kick you out. If you do want to do illegal stuff with it you are free to fork this project but I am not responsible for any damages you do to yourself or others.

If you would like to be a contributer you must not develop bot features, steal any propertariy code from OS Buddy. This client must not break any 3rd party client rules.
